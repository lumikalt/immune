#+title: Antibodies

A protein that binds specifically to a particular substance—called its antigen. Each antibody molecule has a unique structure that enables it to bind specifically to its corresponding antigen, but all antibodies have the same overall structure and are known collectively as immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced by differentiated B cells (plasma cells) in response to infection or immunization and bind to and neutralize pathogens or prepare them for uptake and destruction by phagocytes.
