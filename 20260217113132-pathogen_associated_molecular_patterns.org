#+title: Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns

Simple molecules and regular patterns of molecular structure that are part of many microorganisms but not the host's own cells.

These include:
- Mannose-rich oligosaccharides
- Peptidoglycans
- Lipopolysaccharides
  (Of the Bacterial Wall)
- Unmethylated CpG DNA
  (Unmethylated Cytosine-Guanine Dinucleotide in DNA)

All of these microbial elements were conserved during evolution, making them excellent targets for recognition, as they do not change.
