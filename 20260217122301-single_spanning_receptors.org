#+title: Single-Spanning Receptors

A single-pass membrane protein, also known as single-spanning protein or bitopic protein is a transmembrane protein that spans the lipid bilayer only once.
They are the majority of transmembrane proteins, contributing significantly to the network of interactions between different proteins in cells.
They usually include at least one water-soluble protein domain situated at different sides of biological membranes.
